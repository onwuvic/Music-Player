# Music-Player
A Simple Music Player with HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript.
It was inspired by codefrog UI design.
It contains 7 musics file in the music folder.
I used FontAwesome for the font icons.
The js folder contains two script file ES5 version and ES6 version.
Code with a cup of choco and music by Hillsong - Even When it Hurts.
